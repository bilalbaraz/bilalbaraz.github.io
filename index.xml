      <description>I created a repository on GitHub. Repository contains a file called License. I have an existing repository on my local environment. When I try to push that repository, got an error: fatal: refusing to merge unrelated history
I tried to pull from remote source. But did not work. I got an error like that.
I was looking for any solution on Google. I found it quickly. I did append a flag: --allow-unrelated-histories.</description>

      <description>What is Hugo? Hugo is a static site generator by written in Go. I was looking for any generator to publish something nowadays. I have been using WordPress for a personal blog before. But that looks boring to me anymore. I came across Hugo framework. I loved it. I highly would like to suggest you to use that framework. There are also a lot of alternatives. You can find them by surfing.</description>
